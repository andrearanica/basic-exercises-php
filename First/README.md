# First exercise
<!--First exercise of PHP: you can log into a page (you can find usernames and passwords into ```accounts.txt```)-->
Go to ```index.php``` and insert username and password. If username or password is wrong the script will return back; otherwise, the script shows you all the users saved into the file ```accounts.txt```.
